Seizure Experiment Readme

This folder contains the code that was used to run the experiments discussed in the paper. Each experiment was run by making minor changes to a jupyter notebook called Example_Experiment.ipynb. Reading through that notebook is the best place to start in understanding how to run experiments.

Here is a summary of the other folders located here. "previous_experiments" contains the notebooks that were used to run all of the previous experiments. The names of the notebooks corresponds to the data file with the same name.  

"MaxwellGI" contains the source code used by
Example_Experiment in order to control all of the devices.

"files" is where the resulting data from an experiment is placed. There are two general categories of files. "opto" contains the files that relate to the optogenetics device. "maxwell" is where the files that relate to the high density cmos device are located.
