# Theta Wave Video Source Code

This notebooks contains the source code for creating the theta wave video animtaitons. The file `code_theta_waves_video.ipynb` contains the primary code for creating the animations. As an example, it creates one of the video animations shown in the paper. It uses the histology image `john2.png` as the background in the video. The code in the notebook calls a few minor functions for loading in the data and visualizing the spike raster. These additional functions can be found in the `src` folder.
